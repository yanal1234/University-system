## 📖 Project Overview
The **JUST University Management System** is a comprehensive project developed in C++, designed to simulate a real-world university environment. This system provides advanced solutions for managing all academic and administrative operations, making it an effective tool for students, teachers, and administrators.

The project's primary goal is to deliver a centralized system that facilitates interaction among all involved parties. It covers essential aspects such as:
* **User Data Management:** Organizing and storing information for students, teachers, and administrators.
* **Academic Operations:** Streamlining course registration, withdrawal, and the viewing of academic records.
* **Grades Management:** A fully integrated system for adding and automatically updating student grades.
* **Effective Communication:** Providing a mechanism for complaints and reports to ensure continuous communication between users and the administration.

The system was built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, applying advanced concepts like **Inheritance** and **Encapsulation**. It also utilizes **data templates** to provide greater flexibility in data management. Furthermore, it relies on **text files** for permanent data storage, ensuring that no data is lost when the program is closed.
